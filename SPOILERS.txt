This text file documents the entire playthrough of the game.

It is used by me for storyboarding and planning out the flow of the game.

Development of this game is done with a documentation-first approach:
    * Features are documented precisely first, then implemented in code.
    * All code of the game is expected to follow the documentation that defines it.

    * 'Submit' is pressed, and the numbers on the screen are not ordered largest to smallest, left to right.

[LEVEL 10]

    * Drag all of the numbers on the screen, including the level number, inside the box.
      This time (shown by the immovable '0x' text predicating the box) the player must make the
      largest hexidecimal number.

After completing this level successfully, advance to the [WIN] level.
